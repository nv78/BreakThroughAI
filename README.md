# BreakThroughAI

The Break Through AI Program helps students gain the skills they need to get jobs in the fastest-growing areas of tech: data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Developed by industry and academic leaders, students begin with a summer ML Engineering curriculum that teaches the critical, practical skills that help qualify candidates for entry-level jobs in the field including skills in building data analysis pipelines, training and validating ML models, while gaining experience with common ML/AI libraries. 

Next, students join the AI Studio where they work in teams to solve industry challenges and develop a portfolio of AI projects that demonstrate their capabilities. Throughout the program, students receive career coaching, mentorship, and summer internship placement support, all aimed at helping participants successfully launch their AI tech career.
